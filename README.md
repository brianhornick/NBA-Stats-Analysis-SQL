# Analyzing NBA Data from the Last Decade with SQL - The 3 pointer and it's affect on the game
## Introduction
We have been given a dataset containing comprehensive game stats, player stats, and team stats for every game from the 2013-14 season up until the 2022-23 season. This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com. [NBA Boxscore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukedip/nba-boxscore-dataset) The NBA has seen a huge increase in 3-point shots both made and attempted in the last decade. We aim to use this data to answer some unique questions regarding 3-pointers that will give more insight into how much the 3-pointer really affects winning games. 

#### Questions

What was the average number of 3s taken per game by a team in the 2013-2014 vs the 2022-2023 season?

Which teams has taken the most 3s across this entire decade? What is their overall winning percentage compared to the teams with the least amount of 3s taken?

Do more 3PA (3-point attempts) lead to higher TS% (True shooting percentage)? 

Does having a center that can shoot 3s boost win %?

What results in more wins? Outrebounding opponents vs making more 3-pointers.
